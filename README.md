# Capsule retnetion treatment with acoustic waves

This repositery contains valuable information about a possible treatment for capsule retention (CR). CR is when an endoscopic capsule get stuck in the digestive track. The only two solutions that currently exist are surgery and endoscopy. 

By using sound waves, we think it could be possible to dislodge de capsule by creating pression differentials around the capsule.

In this repositery, you will find mathematic equations that describe the movement of the capsule caused by the treatment and other ways to calculate the pression around the capsule.
