# Capsule retention treatment with acoustic waves

This repository contains valuable information about a possible treatment for capsule retention (CR). CR is when an endoscopic capsule gets stuck in the digestive tract. The only two solutions that currently exist are surgery and endoscopy. 

You will find mathematic equations that describe the movement of the capsule caused by the treatment and other ways to calculate the pressure around the capsule.

# The project
Endoscopic capsules are cameras that can travel through the digestive system, offering an alternative to traditional endoscopy for diagnosis. They are increasingly used to diagnose conditions like abnormal bleeding or Crohn's disease. However, there is a risk of the capsule getting stuck inside the patient (capsule retention), requiring additional procedures for removal. Techniques using high-frequency waves for object manipulation, while promising, may have long-term effects on the body. An alternative approach involves using very low-frequency waves to create pressure differentials and potentially move the capsule by a few millimetres. This technique takes inspiration from the natural peristaltic motion of the digestive system and involves delivering small impulses to generate a strong enough force for movement.

# The results
To test this hypothesis, we used a ballistic gel block with a 10% concentration of animal gelatin, which simulates human muscle tissue characteristics. We placed a capsule with similar properties to an endoscopic capsule in a trench slightly larger than the capsule itself, which we created in the gel. Finally, we vibrated the gel using a low-frequency transducer.

Our tests confirmed that the capsule indeed showed a significant positive displacement after undergoing the treatment. Considering that the distance travelled by the capsule is greater than most obstacles in the stomach, we can conclude that our technique should be sufficient to dislodge a capsule stuck in stomach folds or even a slight indentation. Further tests will be necessary to confirm the effectiveness of such a treatment, but we find our results promising.

In conclusion, our project demonstrated the feasibility of using low-frequency waves to move an endoscopic capsule in a simulated medium. We experimented using a ballistic gel block to mimic the human body and installed a transducer to emit low-frequency waves onto a capsule of the same size as an endoscopic capsule. The results showed that our technique can move the capsule by a few millimetres, which could be enough to dislodge a capsule if it is obstructed by stomach folds or indentations.
